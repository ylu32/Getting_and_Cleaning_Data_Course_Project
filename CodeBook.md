
Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Files should include CodeBook.md, a code book that describes the variables, the data, and works to generate data and run_analysis.R, a code to perform the data generation

The run_analysis.R script is created for data preparation project and includes 5 steps required as described in the course project


library(dplyr)
1. download the data from website
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset


2. read all data from the download data sets
feature <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns

activity <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
x_train <- train/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
y_train <- train/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns


3. combine both train and test data together
X is combined by x_train and x_test using rbind()
Y is combined by y_train and y_test using rbind()
Subject is combined by subject_train and subject_test using rbind()
combined_data is generated by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() and it contains 10299 rows, 563 column


4. extract measurements w/ mean and standard deviation
tidydata is generated from combined_data by selecting subject, index and the measurements w/ mean and standard deviation and it contains 10299 rows, 88 columns
change descriptive activity names to index of the activities in the tidydata

change variable names be descriptive
code column in tidydata renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time


5. get final data from tidydata by averaging each variable for each activity and each subject
fainal_data is generated by sumarizing tidydata w/ means of each variable for each activity and each subject and groupped by subject and activity. this data contains 180 rows, 88 columns
write final_data into final_data.txt tab-delimited textfile
